# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenges

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation

## Description of design choices
Originally we were planning on making it a square, but we decided to set it upon ourselves to try and make a diamond. We went with drawing a shape because we thought it would be more impressive for the robot to draw a shape we had in mind instead of it going through a maze. Also, we didn't want to put a lot of stress on ourselves because other options would've definitely been challenging. 
## Challenges faced and solutions
We faced a lot of coding difficulites. We lso went through many trial and error when trying to get the exact dimensions to get it to the exact shape we wanted it to be. Although we did accomplish our goal, it was very difficult for us to get our code starting and working. So instead of just giving up we asked for help from other students and they gave us just enough of help for us to finish on our own. 
## Future enhancements
We'd definitley would've liked to have more of a detailed design on our diamond so people stop thinking it is for superman. Also, we would've liked to add a song or a mini lightshow for the finished image.
